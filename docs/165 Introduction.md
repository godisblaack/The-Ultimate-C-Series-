## 1. Concept Introduction

* **Purpose of Exceptions**: Mechanism to **signal and handle errors** in a structured way.
* Without exceptions â†’ error handling is often messy (return codes, flags).
* With exceptions â†’ errors are **explicit**, **propagate automatically**, and can be handled in one place.

## 2. What Youâ€™ll Learn in This Section

1. **What exceptions are** and how they differ from normal control flow.
2. **How to throw exceptions** when an error occurs.
3. **How to catch exceptions** and handle them safely.
4. **Creating custom exception classes** for more descriptive error reporting.
5. **Using `noexcept` keyword** to enforce or document functions that should not throw exceptions.

## 3. Visual Mental Model

```
[Error occurs] â†’ throw exception
                 â†“
        [Stack unwinds automatically]
                 â†“
        [catch block handles it]
```

* Instead of returning error codes, you *throw* an object.
* Runtime searches for a matching `catch`.
* If none is found â†’ program terminates.

---

## 4. Best Practices & Insights

* Use exceptions for **exceptional situations** (not regular control flow).
* Keep them **rare but meaningful** (invalid input, failed resource allocation, logic violations).
* Keep normal code separate from error-handling code â†’ improves readability.

## 5. Interview Insights

**Q:** Why use exceptions instead of error codes?
**A:** Exceptions separate error-handling from normal logic, propagate automatically, and make code cleaner.

**Q:** What happens if no `catch` handles an exception?
**A:** The program calls `std::terminate()` and exits.

**Q:** What is `noexcept`?
**A:** A keyword in C++11+ that marks a function as not throwing exceptions, improving performance and clarity.

## 6. Quick Revision

* **throw** â†’ to signal an error.
* **catch** â†’ to handle the error.
* **Custom exceptions** â†’ for domain-specific error messages.
* **noexcept** â†’ promise that a function wonâ€™t throw.
